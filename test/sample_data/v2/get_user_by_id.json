      "description": "I'm a naturalist! I co-founded iNat, but <a href=\"https://kueda.net/blog/2026/01/06/why-i-left-inat/\">I quit in 2025</a>. You can keep up with what I'm doing on <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://kueda.net\">kueda.net</a>,  <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://sfba.social/@kueda\">Mastodon</a>, <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kueda.net\">Bluesky</a>, and yes, even <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/kueda\">Patreon</a>.\n\nA little about me: I've been fascinated by nature for as long as I can recall.  I used to horrify my mom by waltzing into the house holding snakes and salamanders to show her.  Eventually, I translated that love into a degree in biology.  Since then, I've worked as a GIS technician, web developer, and wildlife technician.  iNaturalist grew out of the belief that I might not be alone in my desire to combine nature and the Web. iNat has rendered that belief unnecessary.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the origins of iNat, <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthclub.org/events/archive/podcast/snake-seeker-and-smartphone-can-tech-save-biodiversity-8613\">check out this recording of a description I gave in 2013</a> (starts around 7:40). iNat started as a masters final project at the UC Berkeley School of Information, and they still host our <a href=\"https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2008/inaturalistorg\">slides and report from that project</a>.\n\nIf you want me to join your project, you'll have to describe to me what it does that can't be done at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations. If it's just another combination of place and taxon except with your logo on it, I'll pass.\n\nIf you'd like me to check out an observation / journal post / whatever, please explain why and don't just @ mention me, e.g. \"Hey @kueda, what do you think of this?\" instead of just \"@kueda.\" The latter makes me feel like some kind of pet or robot that you're summoning.\n\nIf you want to use one of my photos in a publication, please abide by the license I have applied to it on iNat. If you're seeking my explicit permission to use my photo in a scientific publication, as of 2021 I will only grant it if your paper will be open access and free for anyone to read in its entirety because I think if you're going to use content that was given away freely to make something else, you should give away the thing you made in the same spirit. And I just don't believe scientific information is property. I know not everyone can afford open access publication fees which is partly why I don't enact those beliefs in my license choices. For commercial field guides, please get in touch.\n\nElsewhere:\n\n* <a href=\"http://bugguide.net/bgimage/user/17693\">BugGuide contributions</a>\n* <a href=\"http://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/contrib_living.php?init=KeUe\">Moth Photographers Group photos</a> (I don't have any control over these, I think they just pick stuff they want from BugGuide after obtaining the photographer's permission)\n* <a href=\"http://tolweb.org/onlinecontributors/app;jsessionid=792468F9D5A89B90B37A359A6893624F?page=ContributorImagesPage&service=external&sp=3565\">Tree of Life contributions</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/216786-ken-ichi?shelf=guides\">my field guides</a> on Goodreads\n* <a href=\"http://ebird.org/ebird/profile/MTMzMTgw\">my pitiful eBird profile page</a>\n* <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://sfba.social/@kueda\">Mastodon</a>",
