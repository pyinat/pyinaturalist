# Introduction
[**iNaturalist**](https://www.inaturalist.org) is a community science platform that helps people
get involved in the natural world by observing and identifying the living things around them.
Collectively, the community produces a rich source of global biodiversity data that can be valuable
to anyone from hobbyists to scientists.

**pyinaturalist** is an unofficial client for the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1) that
aims to make these data easily accessible in the python programming language.

## Features
* **Easier requests:** Complete type annotations for request parameters, and simplified create/update request formats
* **Convenient responses:** Type conversions to the things you would expect in python
* **Docs:** Example requests, responses, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks to help get you started
* **Security:** Keyring integration for secure credential storage
* **Server-friendly:** Client-side rate-limiting that follows the
  [API Recommended Practices](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+recommended+practices),
  so you can be nice to the iNaturalist servers and not worry about rate-limiting errors
* **Test-friendly:** A dry-run mode to preview your requests before potentially modifying data

Many of the most relevant API endpoints are supported, including:
* annotations and observation fields
* identifications
* observations (multiple formats)
* observation photos + sounds
* observation observers, identifiers, histograms, life lists, and species counts
* places
* projects
* species
* users

## Quickstart
Here are usage examples for some of the most commonly used features.

First, install with pip:
```bash
pip install pyinaturalist
```

Then, import the main API functions:
```python
from pyinaturalist import *
```

### Search observations
Let's start by searching for all your own observations. There are
[numerous fields you can search on](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.observations.html#pyinaturalist.v1.observations.create_observation), but we'll just use `user_id` for now:
```python
>>> observations = get_observations(user_id='my_username')
```

The full response will be in JSON format, but we can just print out a few basic details:
```python
>>> for obs in observations['results']:
>>>    pprint(obs)
[78242978] Species: Agelastica alni (Alder Leaf Beetle) observed by niconoe on 2021-05-10 18:45:38+01:00 at 1428 Braine-l'Alleud, Belgique
[78218860] Genus: Bradybatus observed by niconoe on 2021-05-10 15:22:49+01:00 at 1428 Braine-l'Alleud, Belgique
...
```

You can also get
[observation counts by species](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.observations.html#pyinaturalist.v1.observations.get_observation_species_counts).
On iNaturalist.org, this information can be found on the 'Species' tab of search results.
For example, to get the counts of all your own research-grade observations:
```python
>>> counts = get_observation_species_counts(user_id='my_username', quality_grade='research')
>>> pprint(counts, align=True)
[48473   ]: Species:          Ganoderma applanatum (Artist's bracket): 4
[50310   ]: Species:         Arisaema triphyllum (Jack-in-the-pulpit): 4
[50817   ]:   Genus:                     Auricularia (Wood ear fungi): 3
[81599   ]: Species:                 Silphium perfoliatum (Cup plant): 3
[120215  ]: Species:    Bombus griseocollis (Brown-belted Bumble Bee): 2
...
```

Another useful format is the
[observation histogram](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.observations.html#pyinaturalist.v1.observations.get_observation_histogram),
which shows the number of observations over a given interval. The default is `month_of_year`:
```python
>>> histogram = get_observation_histogram(user_id='my_username')
>>> print(histogram)
{
    1: 8,  # January
    2: 1,  # February
    3: 19, # March
    ...,   # etc.
}
```

### Create and update observations
To create or modify observations, you will first need to log in.
This requires creating an [iNaturalist app](https://www.inaturalist.org/oauth/applications/new),
which will be used to get an access token.
```python
token = get_access_token(
    username='my_username',
    password='my_password',
    app_id='my_app_id',
    app_secret='my_app_secret',
)
```
See
[Authentication](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#authentication)
for additional authentication options, including environment variables, keyrings, and password managers.

Now we can [create a new observation](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.observations.html#pyinaturalist.v1.observations.create_observation):
```python
from datetime import datetime

response = create_observation(
    taxon_id=54327,  # Vespa Crabro
    observed_on_string=datetime.now(),
    time_zone='Brussels',
    description='This is a free text comment for the observation',
    tag_list='wasp, Belgium',
    latitude=50.647143,
    longitude=4.360216,
    positional_accuracy=50,  # GPS accuracy in meters
    access_token=token,
    photos=['~/observations/wasp1.jpg', '~/observations/wasp2.jpg'],
)

# Save the new observation ID
new_observation_id = response[0]['id']
```

We can then [update the observation](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.observations.html#pyinaturalist.v1.observations.update_observation) information, photos, or sounds:
```python
update_observation(
    17932425,
    access_token=token,
    description='updated description !',
    photos='~/observations/wasp_nest.jpg',
    sounds='~/observations/wasp_nest.mp3',
)
```

### Search species
Let's say you partially remember either a genus or family name that started with **'vespi'**-something.
The [taxa endpoint](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyinaturalist.v1.taxa.html#pyinaturalist.v1.taxa.get_taxa)
can be used to search by name, rank, and several other criteria
```python
>>> response = get_taxa(q='vespi', rank=['genus', 'family'])
```

As with observations, there is a lot of information in the response, but we'll print just a few basic details:
```python
>>> pprint(response)
[52747] Family: Vespidae (Hornets, Paper Wasps, Potter Wasps, and Allies)
[92786] Genus: Vespicula
[84737] Genus: Vespina
...
```
