API Reference
=============
iNaturalist currently provides three API versions:

- The original `Rails-based API <https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference>`_ (v0)
  that they also use internally: it is very complete and provides read/write access, but has less
  consistent responses. It is likely that this API will be deprecated at some point in the future.
- The `Node-based API <https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/>`_ (v1) allows read and write access
  to most iNaturalist resources, and is generally faster and more consistent. It is
  missing some of the features of the v0 API, however.
- The `v2 API <https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/>`_ is currently in development, and will
  eventually replace both the v0 and v1 APIs. see
  `this forum thread <https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/obs-detail-on-api-v2-feedback/21215>`_
  if you are interested in testing it out.

Pyinaturalist provides functions to use the v0 and v1 APIs, with experimental v2 features coming soon.
Also see :ref:`endpoints` for an overview of which iNaturalist endpoints are currently implemented.
